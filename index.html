<h1>Apperance</h1>
<br>
<p>
    Satoru is a very tall, lean and muscular man who is in his late twenties and is considered relatively attractive, <br>
    mainly due to his facial features. He has snow-white hair and the Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color.<br>
     Satoru normally covers his eyes with a black blindfold which props up his hair and gives it a spikier appearance.<br>
      When sporting a more casual look, Satoru will wear sunglasses and let his hair down to reach the base of his neck.<br>

While working, Satoru wears a dark blue zip-up jacket with a high collar that's also fairly wide. He wears slim-fit matching black pants and black dress boots.<br>
 Before switching over to a simple blindfold, Satoru used to wear bandages over his eyes. <br>
 Satoru enjoys wearing expensive clothing[7] and has a number of casual looks he'll pair with wearing his sunglasses. <br>
 As a Tokyo Jujutsu High student, Satoru wore the normal school uniform with his sunglasses before adopting any sort of makeshift blindfold.<br>

<h1>Personality</h1>

<p>
    Satoru is a complex individual. He is normally seen to be nonchalant and playful towards his students, close colleagues, <br>
    and friends.However, he is unsympathetic and cruel 
    towards sorcerer executives, an example being his blatant disrespect towards Principal Gakuganji, and his enemies.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="https://www.dexerto.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=3840,quality=75,format=auto/https://editors.dexerto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/28/jujutsu-kaisen-gojo-honored-one.jpeg" 
    width=300
    height=150 
    border="1" style="border-color: brown;"></p>
    Satoru is extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. <br>
His opinion of others often only go as far as his judgement of their strength,<br><br>
greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he is very arrogant.<br>
 He is convinced that he is the strongest in the world, which he technically is, claiming,<br>
 during his fight with Toji Fushiguro, that "throughout the Heavens and earth, he alone is the honored one." This can be further exemplified when he was tasked <br>
 with protecting Riko Amanai, one of the few 'weak' people he genuinely grew to show compassion for.<br>
  However, any empathy of her death was soon negated<br>
 by his extensive amount of pride and arrogance after perfecting his reverse cursed technique in his <br>
 following battle against Toji Fushiguro.<br>

</body>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    During intense battles, Satoru is seen to occasionally fall into a frenzied fighting state, <br>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M7NE9bqyNa0/mqdefault.jpg" 
     border="2" style="border-color: brown;"
    width="300"
    height="150"
    align="right" />
    urged by his determination for victory and undeniable proof that he alone is the strongest. His combative <br> 
    style is characterized by his aggressive and domineering attacks, while flaunting his mastered techniques to his opponents. <br>
   Furthermore, in a crisis, he is capable of being cold-blooded. He will prioritize his enemies' destruction over saving innocent people when he believes <br>
    that the sacrifice is unavoidable. However, this only extends to the people killed by his opponent;<br>
     he will not do any lasting harm to or kill anyone innocent to gain the upper hand.<br>
</p>

<p>
    
</p>

<p>
   
    <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1684642131070312450/pu/img/mfpK2CEVli6BwYKS.jpg:large" border="1" style="border-color: brown;"
    width="300"
    height="150" />
     Nevertheless, despite his haughtiness and strength, Satoru is more human than he first appears. After defeating Toji, <br>
    Satoru retrieved Riko's corpse with a sorrowful look, showing that albeit his recent conceited victory temporarily clouding his feelings, <br>
    he still felt some grief over her death. He sought to kill the Star Religious Group members that were laughing over Riko's death, <br>
    though was stopped by Suguru Geto — who he relied on as a moral compass at that time — before taking any action. Furthermore, <br>
    Satoru was later left visibly horrified and panicked after learning that Suguru, his one and only best friend, had become a murderous curse user. <br>
    Satoru attempted to reason with his friend, but eventually realized and accepted that he lost the one person he truly saw as an equal.<br>
     After having to put an end to Suguru before more calamity arose, it was Satoru's trauma over losing his best friend that caused his ultimate downfall in Shibuya.<br>
      He was also distraught when Yuji seemingly died.

Satoru's endgame is to reform the jujutsu world from the bottom-up through education. He seeks to foster a new generation of sorcerers that he hopes will one day become his equals.

<h1>Abilities and Powers</h1>
<br>

width="300"

align="right"

<p>Overall Skill Level: Even among the special grade sorcerers, Satoru is known to be the strongest sorcerer in the series, <br>
    holding both immense amounts of cursed energy and a dangerously powerful technique.<br>
     No one can seemingly match his skill level in the current storyline, except for the King of Curses, Sukuna.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     As a student, Satoru and Suguru were both considered "the strongest", capable of making short work of experienced and powerful curse users.<br>
      After realizing and perfecting his capabilities, Satoru's abilities vastly increased to where he was able to put Toji Fushiguro into the defensive and ultimately kill him with his strongest technique, <br>
      whereas before he and Geto were no match for the renowned Sorcerer Killer. As he continued to grow, he eclipsed Suguru's might to where Suguru admitted Satoru has truly become the strongest alone. <br>
      Suguru also stated that Satoru had the capability of killing all of humanity by himself, which Suguru admitted was out of his own ability, and didn't even try to fight back when Satoru prepared to kill him, <br>
     although Satoru ultimately relented as he was unable to kill his best friend.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
    </p>

<p>
    in the present, Satoru's might was feared by the higher-ups of the jujutsu society,
     to where Satoru could easily force them to cancel the executions of the likes of the dangerous fellow special-grade sorcerer Yuta Okkotsu and the vessel of Sukuna<br>
      Yuji Itadori and he states that it would be easy for him to kill them all and overthrow the jujutsu society had he actually wanted to. <br>
    Satoru even claimed that he could defeat Sukuna at his full power.
    <br>
    Kenjaku and his group of special-grade cursed spirits were also wary of Satoru's power and skill, 
    with Kenjaku admitting he couldn't defeat Gojo in direct battle. He was capable of entirely overpowering and killing Jogo,<br>
     who was the strongest of the group, and simply his presence was able to force Hanami to retreat, with Gojo almost killing the special-grade cursed spirit with a single attack. <br>
     When Kenjaku and his group finally developed a plan to face him in combat, despite their preparations, Satoru was still capable of easily fending off their assaults and overpowering them,<br>
      leaving them astounded with how exceeding his capabilities truly were,
     killing Hanami and only being defeated due to Kenjaku using his past with Geto to distract him long enough for the Prison Realm to seal him.
