<h1>Gojo Satoru</h1>
<h2>The Strongest</h2>
    
<p>
    Satoru is a complex individual. He is normally seen to be nonchalant and playful towards his students, close colleagues, 
    and friends.However, he is unsympathetic and cruel 
    towards sorcerer executives, an example being his blatant disrespect towards Principal Gakuganji, and his enemies.
</p>
Satoru is extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. 
His opinion of others often only go as far as his judgement of their strength,
 and he is quite apathetic towards anyone he deems weak. Additionally, 
greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he is very arrogant.
 He is convinced that he is the strongest in the world, which he technically is, claiming,
 during his fight with Toji Fushiguro, that "throughout the Heavens and earth, he alone is the honored one." 
 This can be further exemplified when he was tasked 
 with protecting Riko Amanai, one of the few 'weak' people he genuinely grew to show compassion for.
  However, any empathy of her death was soon negated
 by his extensive amount of pride and arrogance after perfecting his reverse cursed technique in his 
 following battle against Toji Fushiguro.

    During intense battles, Satoru is seen to occasionally fall into a frenzied fighting state, 
    urged by his determination for victory and undeniable proof that he alone is the strongest. His combative 
    style is characterized by his aggressive and domineering attacks, while flaunting his mastered techniques to his opponents. 
    Furthermore, in a crisis, he is capable of being cold-blooded. He will prioritize his enemies' destruction over saving innocent people when he believes 
    that the sacrifice is unavoidable. However, this only extends to the people killed by his opponent;
     he will not do any lasting harm to or kill anyone innocent to gain the upper hand.

    Nevertheless, despite his haughtiness and strength, Satoru is more human than he first appears. After defeating Toji, 
    Satoru retrieved Riko's corpse with a sorrowful look, showing that albeit his recent conceited victory temporarily clouding his feelings, 
    he still felt some grief over her death. He sought to kill the Star Religious Group members that were laughing over Riko's death, 
    though was stopped by Suguru Geto — who he relied on as a moral compass at that time — before taking any action. Furthermore, 
    Satoru was later left visibly horrified and panicked after learning that Suguru, his one and only best friend, had become a murderous curse user. 
    Satoru attempted to reason with his friend, but eventually realized and accepted that he lost the one person he truly saw as an equal.
     After having to put an end to Suguru before more calamity arose, it was Satoru's trauma over losing his best friend that caused his ultimate downfall in Shibuya.
      He was also distraught when Yuji seemingly died.

Satoru's endgame is to reform the jujutsu world from the bottom-up through education. He seeks to foster a new generation of sorcerers that he hopes will one day become his equals.
